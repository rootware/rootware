#  Hi, I'm Shah 👋

I'm a theoretical and computational quantum physicist who likes the interface of math, physics and programming. Specifically, I like interfacing machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques with quantum algorithms for solving quantum theory problems as well as designing quantum systems. I'm currently a Senior Scientist at IonQ. My work Github account can be found [here](https://github.com/rootware-ionq).

I usually like working on diverse topics. On the physics side, I work in quantum sensing, quantum computing, quantum information theory, physics informed machine learning, and using reinforcement learning and artificial neural networks to augment quantum algorithms and design tasks (see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=dpsqpvYAAAAJ) ) 

On the programming side, I love coding hobby projects here and there. I use Python, Mathematica and C++ for work, and Rust for personal projects. My obsession with Rust is a bit recent, and am fascinated about its applicability to scientific computing. In the past, I have also used Fortran, Matlab, Java and R.

My personal website (in progress) can be found [here](https://rootware.github.io/). 

## ⭐ Selected Projects
- Interpreting convolutional neural networks and using them as a variational quantum algorithm for qubit systems [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00692)
- Using reinforcement learning to optimize design of quantum sensors and circuits [Sample Github 1](https://github.com/rootware/lattice_evolution),  [Sample Github 2](https://github.com/rootware/BayesianData) used for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07907).
- Playing around with Rust and C++ interfacing, since the RL used for my publications is in C++ and the physics simulations are usually in Rust.
- Implementing my own custom DDQN in Rust using the Burh API. Goal is to make physics informed RL in Rust for my Rust physics projects (ongoing project) [Github](https://github.com/rootware/Reinforcement_Learning_DQN_using_Burn)
- Using Neural Networks to Solve Hamiltonians [Demo](https://github.com/rootware/RBM-for-Quantum-Spin-Hamiltonians)
- Learning about clifford circuit simulations (extremely amateur implementation)[https://github.com/rootware/Clifford_Sim]
